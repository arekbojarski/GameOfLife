# GameOfLife
Another one implementation of Conway's Game of Life
This is my favorite project for learning new computer language. Board is just list of coordinates alive points. Every alive point generate list of 8 coordinates of "neighborhood". Last step is just calculation number of "neighborhood score" and keeping alive points with 2 or 3 "neighborhood score".
That's all! Have fan!
